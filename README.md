# Cryptocurrency Classification Challenge

## Overview

In this challenge, you will apply your understanding of the K-means algorithm and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to classify cryptocurrencies based on their price fluctuations over various timeframes. The goal is to analyze how price changes over different intervals can be used to group cryptocurrencies into clusters.

## Objectives

- **Apply PCA** to reduce the dimensionality of cryptocurrency price data.
- **Use the K-means algorithm** to classify cryptocurrencies into clusters based on their price fluctuations.
- **Examine price changes** over the following intervals:
  - 24 hours
  - 7 days
  - 30 days
  - 60 days
  - 200 days
  - 1 year

## Data Description

The dataset contains cryptocurrency price data across different timeframes. Each entry in the dataset includes the price fluctuations over the specified intervals.

## Steps

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Load the cryptocurrency price data.
   - Preprocess the data as needed for PCA and K-means.

2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
   - Apply PCA to the data to reduce its dimensionality while retaining important features.

3. **K-means Clustering**
   - Use the K-means algorithm to classify the cryptocurrencies into clusters based on their PCA-reduced features.

4. **Analysis**
   - Examine the clusters to understand the classification of cryptocurrencies.
   - Visualize the clusters using appropriate plots.

5. **Visualization**
   - Create scatter plots and other visualizations to represent the clusters and understand the relationships between cryptocurrencies.

## Example Code

Here's a sample code snippet for applying PCA and K-means clustering:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import hvplot.pandas

# Load your data
data = pd.read_csv('path/to/your/data.csv')

# Data preprocessing
# ...

# Apply PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
pca_data = pca.fit_transform(data)

# Fit K-means
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4, random_state=0)
clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(pca_data)

# Create a DataFrame for visualization
df_pca_clusters = pd.DataFrame(pca_data, columns=['PCA1', 'PCA2'])
df_pca_clusters['cluster'] = clusters

# Create a scatter plot
scatter_plot = df_pca_clusters.hvplot.scatter(
    x='PCA1',
    y='PCA2',
    c='cluster',
    cmap='Category10',
    title='Cryptocurrency Clusters',
    xlabel='PCA1',
    ylabel='PCA2'
)

# Display the plot
